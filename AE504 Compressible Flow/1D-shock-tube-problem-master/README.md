# 1D-shock-tube-problem

The Sod shock tube problem, named after Gary A. Sod, is a common test for the accuracy of computational fluid codes, like Riemann solvers, and was heavily investigated by Sod in 1978. 
I have used Steger-Warming splitting scheme
In Steger-Warming splitting scheme, the flux terms are approximated using the information from their upwind terms.
